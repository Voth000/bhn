"Burnout and Sowings the flowers" is an interactive website project featured in the virtual expo "Light Up the Burnt Out" by @bapxao.oi. It's a digital sanctuary where blooming flowers represent transformation and your 3D melting avatars reflect the evolving nature of burnout.
Engage with the html canvas, plant flowers on your avatars, and express yourself creatively. 

This interactive experience fosters self-reflection, introspection, and the exploration of resilience and growth. As you delve into this transformative journey, you will come to realize that burnout is not an endpoint but a new beginning.

I perceive this phase as a time to plant the seeds of personal growth, allowing individuals to explore inner mindfulness and nurture a profound self-love.
